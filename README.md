Objectlab Party Server : Installation
============
The 'party server' does just that: it serves the party, dude.  Not the Party (in the Bolshevik sense), but *the Par-tay.*

Actually, it handles things like:
  
* User Registration
* Image Upload
* Beacon 'Claiming'
* Bar Score Updating

Version
--
1.0

Installation
------------
The server has only been tested on *nix (specifically Ubuntu), but should work with any Python 2.6+ installation.
  
First you need to have Python installation.  
Next big item, mysql.
  
Next, you need to set up Bottle.

Bottle dependencies

* pip install mysql-python
* pip intall bottle-mysql
* pip install beaker

Installing mysql 

sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client.





OLD STUFF

Dillinger
=========

Dillinger is a cloud-enabled HTML5 Markdown editor.

  - Type some Markdown text in the left window
  - See the HTML in the right
  - Magic

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site] [1]:

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable 
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.
